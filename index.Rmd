# About Myself

My name is Simon Raymond. I am finishing my Fourth year at Saint Maryâ€™s University in Halifax NS. I intend to keep learning Machine Learning techniques outside of a classroom. This is where i will be uploading some of my generic or basic Algorithms and Practices.

Contact: simon.raymond@smu.ca

## Purpose

I want to display a few things 

(1) Show some basic skeletons of how to build machine learning algorithms
(2) Make some more practical applications
(3) Explain key concepts
(4) Keep track of my learning goals


## Notes for public


The main purpose of this bookdown is not for the public. However all codes are made availible. Due to some issues while knitting this bookdown much of the code was converted to base R code.
