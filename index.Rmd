# About Myself

My name is Simon Raymond. I have finished my Third year at Saint Maryâ€™s University in Halifax NS. I currently have not picked a major but i am very interested in Econometrics and Machine learning.

I intend to keep learning Machine Learning techniques outside of a classroom. This is where i will be uploading some of my generic or basic Algorithms and Practices.

Contact: simon.raymond@smu.ca

## Purpose

I want to display a few things 

(1) Show some basic skeletons of how to build machine learning algorithms
(2) Make some more practical applications
(3) Explain key concepts
(4) Keep track of my learning goals
